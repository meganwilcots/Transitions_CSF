#Create a tibble with all of the files in the LTER transitions directory
#Don't need to change this since this is where all of the raw files are located

#my account is under "1" yours may be different 


#Download the dataset based on the file name in the directory
drive_download(file = subset(files_ls,name=="SEV_wenndex_biomass_2021.csv"),

#load data from the directory

sevwen<-read.table("raw_data_GDrive/SEV_wenndex_biomass_2021.csv", sep=",",header = T)

## Working data frame

unique(sevwen$site)
# only 1 site--warming site

#Twice a year sampling
unique(sevwen$season)
sevwen$seas_num<-as.numeric(as.character(recode_factor(sevwen$season,fall="0.5",spring="0")))
sevwen$year_seas<-sevwen$year+sevwen$seas_num

### Add ExpYear
df <- data.frame(year_seas= seq(from=min(sevwen$year_seas),to=max(sevwen$year_seas), by=0.5),
                 ExpYear= seq(from=1,to=(max(sevwen$year_seas)-min(sevwen$year_seas)+1), by=0.5))
sevwen <- merge.data.frame(sevwen, df, by="year_seas" )


## Split up the different types of treatments into separate columns
unique(sevwen$treatment)
# 8 unique trts
#T=night time warming
#P=winter precip addition
#N= N addition
#C=control
treat.df<-data.frame(treatment=unique(sevwen$treatment),
                     warm=c("T","T","C","C","T","T","C","C"),
                     rainfall=c("C","P","P","C","P","C","P","C"),
                     Nadd=c("C","N","C","N","C","N","N","C"))
sevwen <- merge.data.frame(sevwen, treat.df, by="treatment" )
